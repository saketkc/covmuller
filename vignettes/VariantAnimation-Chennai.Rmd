## Overall, how much has Chennai sequenced over months?

While the absolute numbers are informative, a more useful metric is the proportion of cases (cases sequenced over total cases) that are getting sequenced. Here we look at the proportion of cases that have been sequenced in India over the course of the pandemic:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
chennai_monthly_cases_tmp <- chennai_monthly_cases %>% select(MonthYear, value)
chennai_monthly_cases_tmp$State <- "India"
chennai_monthly_cases_tmp$type <- "Confirmed"

chennai_monthly_cases_tmp <- chennai_monthly_cases_tmp %>% select(MonthYear, State, value, type)
sequencing_proportion <- CombineSequencedCases(
  cases_sequenced = chennai_seq_stats,
  confirmed_long = chennai_monthly_cases_tmp
)
p3 <- BarPlot(sequencing_proportion, yaxis = "percent_sequenced_collected", ylabel = "%  deposited to GISAID", color = "yellowgreen", title = "Proportion of cases deposited to GISAID from Chennai (India)", caption = "**Source: gisaid.org and covid19bharat.org<br>**")
p3
```

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=15, warning=FALSE}
p1 / p2 / p3
```

# Distribution of variants


```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
state_month_counts <- SummarizeVariantsMonthwise(gisaid_india %>% filter(custom_city == "Chennai"))
state_month_counts$State <- "Chennai"
state_month_prevalence <- CountsToPrevalence(state_month_counts)
vocs <- GetVOCs()
omicron <- vocs[["omicron"]]

vocs[["omicron"]] <- NULL

state_month_prevalence <- CollapseLineageToVOCs(
  variant_df = state_month_prevalence,
  vocs = vocs,
  custom_voc_mapping = custom_voc_mapping, summarize = FALSE
)

p5 <- StackedBarPlotPrevalence(state_month_prevalence)
