Epicovr currently supports the following features:

* Read and preprocess metadata file downloaded from GISAID: [Vignette](https://saket-choudhary.me/epicovr/articles/Introduction.html)
* Plot variant prevalence: [Vignette](https://saket-choudhary.me/epicovr/index.html)
* Fit multinomial models to variant prevalence data: [India](https://saket-choudhary.me/epicovr/articles/MultinomialModeling_India.html), [USA](https://saket-choudhary.me/epicovr/articles/MultinomialModeling_USA.html), [Canada](https://saket-choudhary.me/epicovr/articles/MultinomialModeling_Canada.html)
* Estimate totals prevalence of variants by projecting case prevalence data on multinomila fits:  [Vignette](https://saket-choudhary.me/epicovr/articles/VariantAnimation.html)
